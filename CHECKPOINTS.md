## 🎯 Future Checkpoints

As you complete each major task, create a new checkpoint:

### Task 1: LLM Service (Planned)
```bash
# After completing Task 1
git tag -a v0.2.0-task1-complete -m "Task 1: LLM Service Complete"
git push origin v0.2.0-task1-complete
```

### Task 2: STT Service (Planned)
```bash
# After completing Task 2
git tag -a v0.3.0-task2-complete -m "Task 2: STT Service Complete"
git push origin v0.3.0-task2-complete
```

### Task 3: TTS Service (Planned)
```bash
# After completing Task 3
git tag -a v0.4.0-task3-complete -m "Task 3: TTS Service Complete"
git push origin v0.4.0-task3-complete
```

## 📚 How to Use Checkpoints

### View All Checkpoints
```bash
git tag -l
```

### Go to a Specific Checkpoint
```bash
# Go to Task 0 complete
git checkout v0.1.0-task0-complete

# Look around, test things
# Your files will be exactly as they were at that checkpoint
```

### Return to Latest Development
```bash
git checkout main
```

### Compare Current State to Checkpoint
```bash
# See what changed since Task 0
git diff v0.1.0-task0-complete
```

### Create a New Branch from Checkpoint
```bash
# If you want to try something without affecting main
git checkout -b experiment-branch v0.1.0-task0-complete
```

## 🔄 Recovering from Problems

### If You Break Something:

**Option 1: Reset to Checkpoint (Destructive)**
```bash
# ⚠️ WARNING: This will discard ALL changes!
git checkout main
git reset --hard v0.1.0-task0-complete
git push --force origin main  # Only if you want to reset GitHub too
```

**Option 2: Copy Files from Checkpoint (Safe)**
```bash
# Get a specific file from checkpoint
git checkout v0.1.0-task0-complete -- path/to/file
```

**Option 3: Compare and Merge (Recommended)**
```bash
# See what's different
git diff v0.1.0-task0-complete

# Manually fix what's broken
```

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Create checkpoints after completing major tasks**
   - Each task completion = new checkpoint
   - Name them clearly: `v0.X.0-taskN-complete`

2. **Never modify pushed tags**
   - Tags are meant to be permanent markers
   - Create new tags instead

3. **Test before tagging**
   - Make sure everything works
   - Run health checks
   - Test API endpoints

4. **Document each checkpoint**
   - Update this file with what's working
   - Note any special configuration
   - Record instance IDs and URLs

5. **Push tags to GitHub**
   - `git push origin TAG_NAME`
   - So you can access from anywhere

## 📋 Checkpoint Checklist

Before creating a new checkpoint, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Docker services build successfully
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No sensitive data in commits
- [ ] Changes are committed
- [ ] Working on main branch (or merge feature branch)

Then create the checkpoint:
```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z-description -m "Detailed message"
git push origin vX.Y.Z-description
```

Update this file with the new checkpoint info!
