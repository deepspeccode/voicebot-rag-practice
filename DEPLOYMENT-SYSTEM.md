## 🎯 Three Ways to Deploy

### Option 1: Master Script (Recommended) ⭐

**Best for**: New deployments, learning, reproducibility

```bash
./deploy/MASTER-DEPLOY.sh
```

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Checks prerequisites
2. ✅ Verifies AWS configuration
3. ✅ Creates security groups
4. ✅ Creates IAM roles
5. ✅ Launches EC2 instance
6. ✅ Provides setup commands
7. ✅ Saves deployment info

**Time**: 3 minutes + follow instructions  
**Tested**: ✅ Yes

---

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

**Best for**: Understanding each step, customization

**Step 1 - Launch Instance** (on Mac):
```bash
# Use AWS Console or:
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-UBUNTU-22-04 \
  --instance-type t3.large \
  --security-group-ids sg-YOUR-SG \
  --iam-instance-profile Name=VoicebotEC2Profile \
  --region us-east-1
```

**Step 2 - Connect**:
```bash
aws ssm start-session --target i-YOUR-INSTANCE-ID
```

**Step 3 - Setup** (on EC2):
```bash
wget https://github.com/deepspeccode/voicebot-rag-practice/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
sudo apt install -y unzip
unzip main.zip
mv voicebot-rag-practice-main voicebot-rag-practice
cd voicebot-rag-practice
chmod +x deploy/setup-production.sh
./deploy/setup-production.sh
```

**Step 4 - Deploy** (on EC2):
```bash
sudo cp -r ~/voicebot-rag-practice/* /opt/app/
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /opt/app
cd /opt/app
mkdir -p services/{llm,stt,tts,rag,nginx}
mkdir -p monitoring/prometheus monitoring/grafana/{dashboards,datasources}
echo 'FROM alpine:latest
CMD sleep infinity' | tee services/{llm,stt,tts,rag,nginx}/Dockerfile

cat > monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml << 'EOF'
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['app:8080']
EOF

newgrp docker
docker compose up -d app postgres prometheus grafana
```

**Time**: 20-30 minutes  
**Tested**: ✅ Yes (you just did this!)

---

### Option 3: User Data (Future)

**Best for**: Completely automated deployments

Use `deploy/ec2-user-data.sh` when launching instance.

**Time**: Automatic, 10-15 minutes  
**Tested**: ⚠️ Not yet tested

## 💾 State Management

The deployment system tracks state in:

**Mac**: `~/.voicebot-deploy-state`
```
aws_region=us-east-1
instance_type=t3.large
security_group_id=sg-xxxxx
instance_id=i-xxxxx
public_ip=x.x.x.x
```

**EC2**: `deployment-info.txt`
```
Instance ID, IPs, connection commands, management commands
```

**Recovery**: If you lose track, check these files!

---

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### New Deployment
```bash
./deploy/MASTER-DEPLOY.sh
# → Follow instructions
# → Instance ready in 15 minutes
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Morning: Start instance
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-YOUR-ID

# Get IP and connect
# Work on your code
# Test changes

# Evening: Stop instance
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-YOUR-ID
```

### Redeploy from Scratch
```bash
# Terminate old
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-OLD-ID

# Deploy new
./deploy/MASTER-DEPLOY.sh
```
