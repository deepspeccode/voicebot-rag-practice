## üöÄ How to Use This Tracking System

### 1. Starting a Task
```bash
# Checkout the issue in Cursor
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/task-1-llm-service

# Work on the task, commit frequently
git commit -am "feat(llm): add vLLM server setup"
git push -u origin HEAD

# Create PR when ready
gh pr create --fill
```

### 2. Moving Through Phases
- **Backlog** ‚Üí **In Progress** when you start working
- **In Progress** ‚Üí **Review** when PR is ready
- **Review** ‚Üí **Done** when PR is merged

### 3. Tracking Progress
- Use the GitHub project board to visualize progress
- Update issue descriptions with completed steps
- Link PRs to issues for traceability
- Use labels to filter and organize tasks

## üìà Performance Targets (SLOs)

### Key Metrics to Track
- **First Token Latency:** ‚â§ 300ms (text) / ‚â§ 700ms (voice)
- **Audio ‚Üí Transcript:** ‚â§ 800ms
- **Streaming Rate:** ‚â• 30 tokens/s on 8B model
- **End-to-End P99:** ‚â§ 2.5s
- **Concurrent Users:** ‚â• 100
- **Uptime:** 99.9%

### Monitoring Dashboard
Set up Grafana dashboards to track:
- Response times across all services
- Error rates and success rates
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, GPU)
- User experience metrics

## üîÑ Workflow Best Practices

### Daily Workflow
1. Check project board for current status
2. Pick next task from Backlog
3. Move to In Progress and start working
4. Create feature branch and work incrementally
5. Create PR when task is complete
6. Move to Review column
7. Merge PR and move to Done

### Weekly Review
1. Review completed tasks and lessons learned
2. Update documentation and README
3. Plan next week's priorities
4. Check performance metrics and SLOs
5. Update project timeline if needed
