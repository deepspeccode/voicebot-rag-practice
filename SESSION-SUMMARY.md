## 💰 Cost Summary

### Current Usage:
- **Instance**: c7i-flex.large at ~$0.08/hour
- **Storage**: 50GB at ~$4/month
- **Free Credits**: $100 remaining (183 days left)
- **Running time today**: ~2 hours = ~$0.16 (covered by credits)

### Cost Projection:
- **If 24/7**: ~$60/month (your credits last ~2 months)
- **If 8hr/day**: ~$20/month (credits last ~5 months)
- **If stop when not using**: Minimal (~$4/month for storage)

### Recommendation:
✅ **Stop instance when not using** - Your $100 credits will last months!

---

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Today:
1. **Stop your EC2 instance** to save credits
   ```bash
   aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-051cb6ac6bf116c23 --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **Review what you built** (take pride in it!)
   ```bash
   ls -la deploy/
   cat DEPLOYMENT-SYSTEM.md
   ```

3. **Take a break** - You earned it! ☕

### Tomorrow or Next Session:
1. **Start instance**
   ```bash
   aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-051cb6ac6bf116c23 --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **Begin Task 1** - Implement LLM service
   ```bash
   gh issue view 2
   git checkout -b feat/task-1-llm-service
   ```

3. **Use your deployment system** to iterate quickly
