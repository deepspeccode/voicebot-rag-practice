# Git Commit Strategy

## 🎯 Commit Philosophy

We commit **early and often** to maintain a clean git history and enable easy rollbacks. Each commit should represent a **logical unit of work** that can be understood and potentially reverted independently.

## 📝 Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): Brief description

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
Include any breaking changes or important notes.

✅ What was completed
🔧 What was fixed
🧪 What was tested
🎯 Next steps
```

### Types:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Scopes:
- `llm` - LLM service changes
- `app` - Main application changes
- `docker` - Docker/containerization
- `docs` - Documentation
- `scripts` - Automation scripts

## 🔄 Commit Frequency

### ✅ Commit When:
- A logical unit of work is complete
- A feature is working and tested
- Documentation is updated
- A bug is fixed
- Before starting a new major change
- At the end of each work session

### ❌ Don't Commit:
- Broken code
- Incomplete features
- Temporary debugging code
- Large unrelated changes

## 📋 Commit Checklist

Before each commit, ask:
- [ ] Does this commit represent a logical unit of work?
- [ ] Is the code working and tested?
- [ ] Are there any temporary files or debug code?
- [ ] Is the commit message clear and descriptive?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable reverting this commit?
